###### Introduction to Game Theory (IT:U Spring 2025)

As part of the Project-Integrated Course (PIC) on *Analyzing Human Behavior*, I delivered a 2-day class on game theory (on May 8-9, 2025). The class aimed to give a gentle introduction to game theory with minimal mathematical formalism. There were three theoretical blocks, covering the basics ([Part 1](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part1.pdf)), evolutionary game theory ([Part 2](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part2.pdf)), and more advanced games ([Part 3](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part3.pdf)). In addition, there was a block on experimental game theory, done by Adile Yasar. 


###### Introduction to Evolutionary Game Theory (ICTS Spring 2025)
As part of the Workshop [Decisions, Games, and Evolution](https://www.icts.res.in/program/DGE2025), held at ICTS Bangalore, I gave four 2h classes on evolutionary game theory. The classes covered a basic introduction ([Part 1](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part1.pdf)), direct reciprocity ([Part 2](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part2.pdf)), indirect reciprocity ([Part 3](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part3.pdf)), and some current research topics ([Part 4](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part4.pdf)). The workshop was fantastic, thanks to the organizers for inviting me.
