This page is meant to share course materials of some of my previous classes. 

###### Research Methodology (IT:U, Winter 2026)
I taught a morning session to explain the basics of inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, parameter estimation) ([pdf](../files/teaching/2026_ResearchMethodology/Notes_Statistics.pdf)).

###### Basics of Probability Theory (IT:U, Fall 2025)

As part of the course *Foundations and Methods 2* for Master students at [IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/), I gave a 3h class on probability theory and how it is used to do inferential statistics ([pdf](../files/teaching/2026_FM2/Notes_Probability.pdf)).

###### A teaser to Game Theory (IT:U, Fall 2025)

As a part of the Project-Integrated Course (PIC) on *Machine Learning and NLP* for the PhD students at [IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/), I gave a very brief intro to game theory ([pdf](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory_short/LectureNotes.pdf)).

###### Research Methodology (IT:U, Spring 2025)

I taught two morning sessions for the Project-Integrated Course (PIC) on *Research Methodology* for the PhD students at [IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/). 
The classes covered the basics of the scientific research process ([Part 1](../files/teaching/2025_ResearchMethodology/part1.pdf)) and research design ([Part 2](../files/teaching/2025_ResearchMethodology/part2.pdf)). In addition, there are three more classes taught by [Jie Mei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n7zXscEAAAAJ&hl=en). 

###### Introduction to Game Theory (IT:U, Spring 2025)

As part of the Project-Integrated Course (PIC) on *Analyzing Human Behavior*, targeted at PhD students at [IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/), I delivered a 2-day class on game theory (on May 8-9, 2025). The class aimed to give a gentle introduction to game theory with a minimum of mathematical formalism. There were three theoretical blocks, covering the basics ([Part 1](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part1.pdf)), evolutionary game theory ([Part 2](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part2.pdf)), and more advanced games ([Part 3](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part3.pdf)). In addition, there was a block on experimental game theory, done by Adile Yasar. 

###### Introduction to Evolutionary Game Theory (ICTS, Spring 2025)
As part of the Workshop [Decisions, Games, and Evolution](https://www.icts.res.in/program/DGE2025), held at ICTS Bangalore, I gave four 2h-classes on evolutionary game theory. The classes targeted an audience of PhD students and of junior Post-Docs. They covered a basic introduction ([Part 1](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part1.pdf)), direct reciprocity ([Part 2](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part2.pdf)), indirect reciprocity ([Part 3](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part3.pdf)), and some current research topics ([Part 4](../files/teaching/2025_EGT/part4.pdf)). The workshop was fantastic, thanks to the organizers for inviting me.
