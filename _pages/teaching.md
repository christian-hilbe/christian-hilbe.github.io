###### Introduction to Game Theory, IT:U Spring 2025

As part of the Project-Integrated Course (PIC) on *Analyzing Human Behavior*, I delivered a 2-day class on game theory (on May 8-9, 2025). The class aimed to give a gentle introduction to game theory with minimal mathematical formalism. There were three theoretical blocks, covering the basics ([Part 1](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part1.pdf)), evolutionary game theory, ([Part 2](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part1.pdf)), and more advanced games ([Part 3](../files/teaching/2025_GameTheory/part3.pdf)). In addition, there was a block on experimental game theory, done by Adile Yasar.
