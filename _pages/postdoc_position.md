#### Open Post-Doc position, 3 years


I am currently looking for a Post-Doc who would work with me and my group at [IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/research/research-groups/game-theory-and-evolutionary-dynamics/). 
In my [group](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/), we use game theory to study questions around cooperation and social preferences: What makes people cooperate and help others? What is the impact of social norms? And what real-world conditions, such as changing environments, extreme inequality or dealing with multiple interaction partners, challenge our assumptions of cooperation?

If these questions interest you, please consider applying for:
### Postdoctoral Fellow

**Details about the position.** The call for this position is open: if you are a social psychologist or economist working with lab experiments, or if you are a modeler with prior experience with (evolutionary) game theory, this position might be for you. 
Applicants are free to develop their own research agenda; but I am also happy to propose topics, if useful. 
The position is for 3 years, with a start date in 2025 (the exact date is negotiable). 
There will be some moderate teaching requirements, mostly to support me in the courses I will offer. 
The salary is competitive, ranging from €4,752.30 to €5,211.80 for junior/senior PostDocs (on a 40-hour full-time basis, gross, 14 times a year).  
In addition you are provided with a [Klima-Ticket](https://www.klimaticket.at/en/home/), which allows you to use all public transport in Austria for free. 


**Details about the working environment.** 
The successful candidate will join our interdisciplinary research group, comprising of psychologists, physicists, and mathematicians. We use tools from game theory, ranging from analytical models and computer simulations to behavioural laboratory and field experiments. We aim to publish our findings in general-audience journals (including Nature, PNAS, Nature Human Behaviour) and top journals in economics, psychology and evolutionary biology. We have weekly group meetings to discuss science, and weekly 1-to-1 meetings with the supervisor to discuss projects. Our group is well connected to research labs worldwide, including in the US, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, China and Japan. Candidates are encouraged to make use of these connections. 

**Details about the university.** 
[IT:U](https://it-u.at/en) is a newly established university in Linz, Upper Austria. 
It focuses on research across disciplinary boundaries, with faculty members having backgrounds in complex systems, AI, data science, and human-computer interactions. 
In the next few years, IT:U will grow quickly, with me joining in mid January 2025. 
Linz is well connected to other major cities in Austria and Germany (e.g., commuting to Vienna takes 1h15 by train).
