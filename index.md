Since 2025, I am Professor of Game Theory and Evolutionary Dynamics, at [IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/).
In my group, we explore social behavior (mostly cooperative behavior), using mathematics, computer simulations, and behavioral experiments.
Before joining IT:U, I was the group leader of the [Max Planck Research Group on the Dynamics of Social Behavior](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/).

For much of our work, we use evolutionary game theory. 
This framework asks how traits or (strategic) behaviors spread in a population. 
Some of the questions I have scientifically addressed in the past are:
How does inequality affect human behavior? 
Which kinds of social norms do people use to sustain cooperation? 
Why do people value modesty? 
And how do individuals react to environmental change?
