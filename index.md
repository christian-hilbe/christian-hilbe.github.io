I am Professor of Game Theory and Evolutionary Dynamics, at the [Interdisciplinary Transformation University](https://it-u.at/en/).
This is a new university in Linz, Austria, that explicitly focuses on research at the intersection of different fields. 

In my [Research Group on the Dynamics of Social Behavior](https://dynamics-social-behavior.github.io/), we explore social behavior (mostly cooperative behavior), using mathematics, computer simulations, and behavioral experiments.
For much of our work, we use evolutionary game theory. 
This framework asks how traits or (strategic) behaviors spread in a population. 
Some of the questions we have scientifically addressed in the past are:
How does inequality affect human behavior and social learning? 
Which kinds of social norms do people use to sustain cooperation? 
And how do individuals react to environmental change? 

Before joining IT:U in 2025, I was the group leader of the [Max Planck Institute](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/) in Pl√∂n, Germany.
