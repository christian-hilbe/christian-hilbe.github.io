** I am currently looking for a [Post-Doc](https://christian-hilbe.github.io/postdoc_position/) **

\
I am the group leader of the [Max Planck Research Group on the Dynamics of Social Behavior](http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/).
In our group, we explore social behavior (mostly cooperative behavior), using mathematics, computer simulations, and behavioral experiments. 

For much of our work, we use evolutionary game theory. 
This framework asks how traits or (strategic) behaviors spread in a population. 
Some of the questions I have scientifically addressed in the past are:
How does inequality affect human behavior? 
Which kinds of social norms do people use to sustain cooperation? 
Why do people value modesty? 
And how do individuals react to environmental change? 

For more information, please have a look at my publications, and the links below.
